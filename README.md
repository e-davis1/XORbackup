# XORbackup
I forgot what it's called, but you can take two binary strings (b1, b2) and xor them to make a third (b3), then if you xor b1 and b3 you get b2, or b2 and b3 and you get b1. This is useful for backing stuff up, so I'm making that.

NB: As of right now, this doesn't work, because it turns out that you have to use .gitignore for intellij stuff. Oops. I'll try and update it asap.
